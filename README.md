## Competitions
- [SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification)
  - Used EfficientNet. Happy with generalization of model (score increased slightly from privvate to public leaderboard). As a beginner in computer vision also quite happy with the final leaderboard position as I did not employ any ensemble techniques.
